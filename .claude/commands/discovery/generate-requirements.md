# Unified Requirements Generator (PRD)

## Project Scope File: $ARGUMENTS (Mandatory)
**Accepts:** Feature specifications | Business requirements | Project scope documents | User needs text

As an expert Business Analyst and Product Manager with deep technical understanding, generate comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) that bridge business needs with technical implementation. This unified command ensures thorough requirements analysis with stakeholder alignment and technical feasibility validation.

## Core Requirements Principles

*** MANDATORY VALIDATIONS ***
- Analyze project scope and business context before requirements generation
- Review existing codebase (if available) to understand current state and constraints
- Validate technical feasibility with architecture and technology stack considerations
- ULTRATHINK the requirements ‚Äî comprehensively analyze business and technical implications
- Request explicit user confirmation (YES/NO) before writing/updating PRD files
- Update existing PRD sections incrementally when file exists; avoid complete overwrites
- Split complex requirements by functional areas and technology stacks when applicable
- Ensure requirements are testable, measurable, and aligned with business objectives
- Include both functional and non-functional requirements comprehensively

## Business Analysis Strategy

The AI agent receives your research findings and domain knowledge. Since agents have codebase access and equivalent knowledge cutoff, embed comprehensive business context and technical constraints in the PRD. Agents have web search capabilities ‚Äî provide specific documentation URLs, industry standards, and best practice references.

## Deep Requirements Analysis Methodology

Optimize for requirements completeness and implementation success over speed. Spawn multiple agents and subagents using batch tools for comprehensive analysis.

### 1. Business Context Analysis
- **Stakeholder Identification**: Map all stakeholders and their requirements priorities
- **Business Objectives**: Align features with strategic business goals and KPIs
- **User Journey Mapping**: Document end-to-end user flows and interaction points
- **Success Metrics**: Define measurable success criteria and acceptance standards
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify business risks and mitigation strategies

### 2. Technical Feasibility Assessment
- **Architecture Alignment**: Verify compatibility with existing system architecture
- **Technology Stack Analysis**: Assess requirements against technology capabilities
- **Integration Requirements**: Identify system dependencies and integration points
- **Performance Implications**: Analyze scalability and performance requirements
- **Security Considerations**: Document security requirements and compliance needs

### 3. Existing System Analysis (If Applicable)
- **Current State Documentation**: Map existing features and functionality
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify differences between current and desired states
- **Impact Assessment**: Analyze effects on existing features and workflows
- **Migration Requirements**: Document data migration and transition needs
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing functionality preservation

### 4. External Research and Standards
- **Industry Best Practices**: Research similar implementations and patterns
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Identify applicable regulations and standards
- **Competitive Analysis**: Study competitor features and market standards
- **Technology Documentation**: Gather framework and library documentation
- **User Research**: Incorporate user feedback and usability studies

## Essential Project Intelligence

### Reference Materials Integration
- **Gotchas Repository**: Examine `References\Gotchas` for technology-specific constraints and guidelines
- **Architecture Patterns**: Review `References\Gotchas\architecture_patterns.md` for system design considerations
- **Anti-Patterns**: Check `References\Gotchas\anti_patterns.md` to avoid common pitfalls
- **Existing Codebase**: Analyze `app`, `backend`, `server` folders for current implementation patterns
- **Documentation Standards**: Follow existing documentation patterns and conventions

*** Comprehensive understanding of business context and technical constraints is non-negotiable ***
