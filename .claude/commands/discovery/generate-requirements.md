# Unified Spec Generator

## Project Scope File: $ARGUMENTS (Mandatory)
**Accepts:** Feature specifications | Business requirements | Project scope documents | User needs text
**Supported File Types:** .pdf | .txt | .md | .docx

### Input Processing Instructions
**CRITICAL**: Before proceeding with requirements generation, you MUST determine input type and process accordingly:

#### Input Type Detection
1. **File Path Detection**: Check if `$ARGUMENTS` contains a file path (contains file extensions .pdf, .txt, .md, .docx)
2. **Direct Text Detection**: If `$ARGUMENTS` doesn't contain a file extension, treat it as direct specification text

#### File Input Processing
If `$ARGUMENTS` is a file path:
1. **File Existence Check**: Verify the file exists using appropriate tools
2. **Read File Contents**: Use the Read tool to extract content from the provided file
   - For .pdf files: Read and extract text content
   - For .txt files: Read plain text content
   - For .md files: Read markdown content
   - For .docx files: Read and extract document content
3. **Content Validation**: Ensure file contents are readable and contain relevant information

#### Direct Text Processing
If `$ARGUMENTS` is direct text specification:
1. **Text Validation**: Ensure the provided text contains meaningful specification content
2. **Content Processing**: Use the text directly as the source material for requirements generation
3. **Length Check**: Verify text is substantial enough for requirements analysis

#### Design Asset Processing (UI Impact Only)
If `$ARGUMENTS` includes design references and has UI impact:
1. **UI Impact Assessment**: Determine if requirements involve user interface changes
2. **Figma Link Detection**: Check for Figma URLs (figma.com/file/, figma.com/proto/)
3. **Design Image Detection**: Check for image paths (.png, .jpg, .svg, .sketch)
4. **Design System References**: Look for design system documentation links

#### Design Asset Extraction (When UI Changes Required)
- **Figma Links**: Store and reference in requirements for UI specifications
- **Image Assets**: Copy to `.propel/context/Design/` folder and reference in specs
- **Design Tokens**: Extract color schemes, typography, spacing systems (UI only)
- **Component Specifications**: Document reusable UI component requirements

#### Fallback Handling
- If file cannot be read: Request user to provide alternative file path or paste content directly
- If text is too brief: Request additional specification details
- If no input provided: Request user to provide either file path or specification text

**Example Usage:**
- `/generate-requirements project_scope.pdf` (file input)
- `/generate-requirements business_requirements.docx` (file input)
- `/generate-requirements "Build a user authentication system with OAuth2 support, password reset functionality, and role-based access control"` (direct text)
- `/generate-requirements Create a mobile app for food delivery with real-time tracking` (direct text)

As an expert Business Analyst and Product Manager with deep technical understanding, generate comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (s) that bridge business needs with technical implementation. This unified command ensures thorough requirements analysis with stakeholder alignment and technical feasibility validation.

## Core Requirements Principles

*** MANDATORY VALIDATIONS ***
- **FIRST**: Process `$ARGUMENTS` input according to Input Processing Instructions above
- **SECOND**: Extract and analyze the specification content (think more about hidden requirements and implications from file or direct text)
- **THIRD**: Analyze project scope and business context before requirements generation
- Review existing codebase (if available) to understand current state and constraints
- **If no codebase exists (green-field project)**: Include EP-TECH epic for project scaffolding
- Validate technical feasibility with architecture and technology stack considerations
- Think deeply and keep thinking about the requirements — think longer to comprehensively analyze business and technical implications
- Request explicit user confirmation (YES/NO) before writing/updating files
- Update existing sections incrementally when file exists; avoid complete overwrites
- Split complex requirements by functional areas and technology stacks when applicable
- Ensure requirements are testable, measurable, and aligned with business objectives
- Include both functional and non-functional requirements comprehensively
- Generate a single unified document at .propel/context/docs/spec.md only

### Content Processing Workflow
1. **Input Analysis**: Determine if `$ARGUMENTS` is file path or direct text
2. **Content Extraction**: Read file content OR use direct text as source material
3. **Content Parsing**: Extract key business requirements, user needs, and technical constraints
4. **Context Integration**: Combine extracted content with codebase analysis and business context
5. **Requirements Generation**: Create comprehensive spec based on processed specification content

## Business Analysis Strategy

The AI agent receives your research findings and domain knowledge. Since agents have codebase access and equivalent knowledge cutoff, embed comprehensive business context and technical constraints in the specification. Agents have web search capabilities — provide specific documentation URLs, industry standards, and best practice references.

## Deep Requirements Analysis Methodology (Think A Lot - Sequential Thinking)

Optimize for requirements completeness and implementation success over speed. Think longer and keep thinking. Spawn multiple agents and subagents using batch tools for comprehensive analysis.

**Fallback Mechanism:** If the sequential-thinking tool fails or is unavailable, automatically fall back to standard iterative analysis approach:
- Perform systematic step-by-step requirement analysis
- Use structured thinking with explicit validation checkpoints
- Apply the same comprehensive methodology without the sequential-thinking tool
- Ensure no degradation in analysis quality or completeness

### 1. Business Context Analysis
Think deeply about business context - keep thinking about stakeholder needs:
- **Stakeholder Identification**: Map all stakeholders and their requirements priorities
- **Business Objectives**: Align features with strategic business goals and KPIs
- **User Journey Mapping**: Document end-to-end user flows and interaction points
- **Success Metrics**: Define measurable success criteria and acceptance standards
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify business risks and mitigation strategies

### 2. Technical Feasibility Assessment
- **Architecture Alignment**: Verify compatibility with existing system architecture
- **Technology Stack Analysis**: Assess requirements against technology capabilities
- **Integration Requirements**: Identify system dependencies and integration points
- **Performance Implications**: Analyze scalability and performance requirements
- **Security Considerations**: Document security requirements and compliance needs

### 2.5. Design and User Experience Analysis (UI Impact Only)
**Apply only if requirements include user interface changes:**
- **UI Impact Assessment**: Clearly identify which features require UI modifications
- **Visual Design Requirements**: Extract design specifications from Figma/images
- **Design System Mapping**: Document colors, typography, spacing, components (UI only)
- **UI/UX Patterns**: Identify interaction patterns and micro-animations
- **Responsive Design**: Document breakpoints and adaptive behaviors
- **Accessibility Standards**: WCAG compliance requirements from designs

### 3. Existing System Analysis (If Applicable)
- **Current State Documentation**: Map existing features and functionality
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify differences between current and desired states
- **Impact Assessment**: Analyze effects on existing features and workflows
- **Migration Requirements**: Document data migration and transition needs
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing functionality preservation

### 4. External Research and Standards
- **Industry Best Practices**: Research similar implementations and patterns
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Identify applicable regulations and standards
- **Competitive Analysis**: Study competitor features and market standards
- **Technology Documentation**: Gather framework and library documentation
- **User Research**: Incorporate user feedback and usability studies

## Essential Project Intelligence

### Reference Materials Integration
- **Gotcha Loading**: Apply Conditional Gotcha Loading Strategy from `.claude/CLAUDE.md` based on specification scope:
  - Load core gotchas (always) - includes architecture_patterns.md and anti_patterns.md
  - Analyze specification for layer detection (UI/frontend, API/backend, database mentions)
  - Load layer-based best_practices based on detected scope
  - Load react_gotchas.md only if React explicitly mentioned
  - Load dotnet_gotchas.md only if .NET/C# explicitly mentioned
- **Existing Codebase**: Analyze `app`, `backend`, `server` folders for current implementation patterns
- **Documentation Standards**: Follow existing documentation patterns and conventions

*** Comprehensive understanding of business context and technical constraints is non-negotiable ***

## User Story Generation Implementation

### Post-Spec Generation Process
**CRITICAL**: After generating the main spec.md file, automatically generate user story files following these steps:

#### 1. Epic Analysis and Story Generation
For each Epic defined in the Epics table within spec.md:

**Epic Processing Algorithm:**
1. **Extract Epic Data**: Parse Epic ID, title, and mapped requirement IDs from the generated Epics table
2. **Requirement Analysis**: Analyze each mapped requirement (think more about FR-, NFR-, TR-, DR-, UXR-) to understand functionality scope
3. **Story Decomposition**: Break down epic requirements into 3-8 user stories following INVEST principles
4. **Effort Estimation**: Ensure each story is ≤ 5 story points (30 hours), break down larger stories
5. **Story File Creation**: Generate individual `.md` files using userstory-base.md template

#### 2. Story File Generation Process
**Directory Structure Creation:**
```bash
# Create directory structure for each story
.propel/context/tasks/US_001/US_001.md
.propel/context/tasks/US_002/US_002.md
.propel/context/tasks/US_003/US_003.md
...
```

**Sequential ID Assignment:**
- Start with US_001 and increment for each story across all epics
- Maintain sequential numbering regardless of epic boundaries
- Use zero-padded 3-digit format (US_001, US_002, ..., US_999)

#### 3. Template Population Requirements
For each generated story file, populate the userstory-base.md template with:

**ID Section:**
- Format: US_001, US_002, US_003 (sequential across all epics)

**Title Section:**
- Concise, action-oriented title (≤ 10 words)
- Focus on user value and functionality

**Description Section:**
- Standard format: "As a [user type], I want [functionality], so that [business value]"
- Derived from requirement analysis and business context

**Acceptance Criteria Section:**
- Given/When/Then format for each criterion
- Specific, measurable, and testable conditions
- Cover normal flow and key variations

**Edge Cases Section:**
- Boundary conditions and error scenarios
- System behavior under exceptional circumstances
- Integration failure scenarios

**Traceability Section:**
- Parent Epic ID (EP-001, EP-002, etc.)
- Map to specific requirements (FR-001, NFR-002, etc.)

**Tags Section:**
- Primary requirement type (FR, NFR, TR, DR, UXR)
- Platform tags (Web, Mobile, API, etc.)
- Domain tags (Authentication, Reporting, Integration, etc.)

#### 4. Story Generation Examples

**Example for EP-001 (User Account Access & Authentication):**
```
US_001: User Registration with Email Validation
- Parent: EP-001
- Requirements: FR-001, UXR-001
- Tags: FR, Web, Authentication

US_002: User Login Authentication
- Parent: EP-001
- Requirements: FR-002, NFR-002
- Tags: FR, NFR, Web, Authentication

US_003: Password Reset Functionality
- Parent: EP-001
- Requirements: FR-002, UXR-001
- Tags: FR, UXR, Web, Authentication
```

#### 5. Technical Epic Handling
**When No Existing Codebase (Green-Field Project):**
Create EP-TECH epic as FIRST epic with scaffolding stories (≤ 5 SP each), including:
- Project setup, infrastructure, and tooling
- Technology stack configuration
- Development environment and build tools

**Technical Story Examples:**
```
US_XXX: Project Structure and Build Configuration
US_XXX: Development Environment Setup
US_XXX: Framework Selection and Integration
US_XXX: CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
US_XXX: Testing Infrastructure Setup
US_XXX: Documentation Foundation
```

#### 6. Quality Validation Checklist
Before completing story generation, validate:
- [ ] All epic requirements mapped to at least one user story
- [ ] Each story follows userstory-base.md template exactly
- [ ] Story effort estimates are realistic (≤ 5 story points)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are specific and testable
- [ ] Edge cases are comprehensively covered
- [ ] Traceability to parent epics is maintained
- [ ] Sequential ID numbering is correct
- [ ] All directories and files are created properly
- [ ] Technical Epic included for new projects

#### 7. Implementation Instructions for AI Agents
**File Creation Process:**
1. **Read userstory-base.md template**: Load the exact template structure
2. **Create directory**: For each story, create `.propel/context/tasks/US_XXX/` directory
3. **Generate story file**: Create `US_XXX.md` file within the directory
4. **Populate template**: Fill all template sections with generated content
5. **Validate structure**: Ensure template compliance and completeness

**Automated Generation Flow:**
```
1. Parse Epics table from generated spec.md
2. For each Epic (process EP-TECH FIRST if green-field project):
   a. Extract mapped requirements
   b. Generate 3-8 user stories
   c. Create story files with sequential IDs
   d. Populate userstory-base.md template
3. Validate all generated stories
4. Confirm file structure and content
```
