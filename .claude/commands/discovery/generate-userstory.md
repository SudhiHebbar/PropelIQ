# User Story Generator

## Command Arguments: $ARGUMENTS (Optional)
**Accepts:** Scope file path [Epic ID] | Epic ID | Feature text | Epic URL
**Default Behavior:** Uses Context/Docs/Spec.md if no arguments provided

### Argument Combinations:
1. **Scope file + Epic ID**: `scope_file.md EP-001` - Generate stories for specific epic within scope file
2. **Scope file only**: `scope_file.md` - Generate stories for all epics in scope file
3. **Epic ID only**: `EP-001` - Find epic in Spec.md and generate stories
4. **No arguments**: Use Context/Docs/Spec.md and generate stories for all epics

### Input Processing Instructions
**CRITICAL**: Before proceeding with user story generation, determine input type and process accordingly:

#### Input Type Detection
**Parse $ARGUMENTS to identify the combination:**

1. **Scope File + Epic ID**: Two arguments where first is file path (.md, .pdf, .txt, .docx) and second is Epic ID (EP-XXX)
2. **Scope File Only**: Single argument that is a file path with extensions (.pdf, .txt, .md, .docx)
3. **Epic ID Only**: Single argument matching Epic ID pattern (EP-001, EP-002, etc.)
4. **Epic URL**: Single argument containing URLs pointing to epic specifications or documents
5. **Direct Text**: Single argument that doesn't match file path or Epic ID patterns
6. **No Arguments**: If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, use Context/Docs/Spec.md as source

#### Scope File + Epic ID Processing (Two Arguments)
If `$ARGUMENTS` has two parts: scope file + Epic ID:
1. **File Validation**: Verify the scope file exists and is readable
2. **Content Extraction**: Read scope file content (supports .pdf, .txt, .md, .docx)
3. **Epic Filtering**: Parse file to find only the specified Epic ID (EP-XXX)
4. **Epic Analysis**: Extract epic details, mapped requirements, and scope for the specified epic only
5. **Story Generation**: Generate user stories for the single identified epic within the scope file

#### Scope File Only Processing (Single File Argument)
If `$ARGUMENTS` is a single file path:
1. **File Existence Check**: Verify the file exists using appropriate tools
2. **Read File Contents**: Use the Read tool to extract content
   - For .pdf files: Read and extract text content
   - For .txt files: Read plain text content
   - For .md files: Read markdown content
   - For .docx files: Read and extract document content
3. **Epic Discovery**: Parse file to identify all epics within the scope file
4. **Multi-Epic Processing**: Generate user stories for ALL epics found in the scope file

#### Epic ID Only Processing (Single Epic Argument)
If `$ARGUMENTS` contains single Epic ID (EP-001, EP-002, etc.):
1. **Spec.md Lookup**: Read Context/Docs/Spec.md to find the specified epic
2. **Epic Extraction**: Extract epic details, mapped requirements, and scope
3. **Story Generation**: Generate user stories for the identified epic only

#### Epic URL Processing (Single URL Argument)
If `$ARGUMENTS` contains URLs:
1. **URL Validation**: Verify URLs are accessible and contain epic/feature specifications
2. **Content Extraction**: Use WebFetch to retrieve epic content from URLs
3. **Epic Parsing**: Extract epic requirements, scope, and business context
4. **Story Generation**: Generate user stories based on epic content

#### Direct Text Processing
If `$ARGUMENTS` is direct text specification:
1. **Text Validation**: Ensure the provided text contains meaningful feature/epic content
2. **Content Processing**: Use the text directly as source material for story generation
3. **Epic Creation**: Create implicit epic structure from text content
4. **Story Generation**: Generate user stories from analyzed text

#### Default Processing (No Arguments)
If no `$ARGUMENTS` provided:
1. **Spec.md Check**: Verify Context/Docs/Spec.md exists and contains epic specifications
2. **All Epics Discovery**: Parse all epics from the Spec.md file
3. **Multi-Epic Processing**: Generate user stories for ALL epics found in the specification file

#### Fallback Handling
- If epic/file cannot be read: Request user to provide alternative input or check accessibility
- If text is too brief: Request additional specification details
- If Spec.md doesn't exist: Request user to run generate-requirements first or provide direct input

**Example Usage:**
- `/generate-userstory scope_document.md EP-001` (specific epic within scope file)
- `/generate-userstory scope_document.md` (all epics in scope file)
- `/generate-userstory EP-001` (specific epic ID from Spec.md)
- `/generate-userstory https://docs.company.com/epic-auth` (epic URL)
- `/generate-userstory "Build user authentication with OAuth2, password reset, and role-based access"` (direct text)
- `/generate-userstory` (all epics from existing Spec.md)

As an expert Product Owner and Business Analyst, generate comprehensive user stories that follow INVEST principles and deliver clear business value. This command focuses specifically on user story creation with detailed acceptance criteria and proper effort estimation.

## Core User Story Principles

*** MANDATORY VALIDATIONS ***
- **FIRST**: Process `$ARGUMENTS` input according to Input Processing Instructions above - CRITICAL: Parse for scope file + epic ID combination first
- **SECOND**: Extract and analyze epic/feature content from the specified source (think longer about business value)
- **THIRD**: Apply user story breakdown rules from CLAUDE.md before story generation (keep thinking about story independence)
- **FOURTH**: Determine scope of processing (single epic vs. all epics) based on argument combination
- Follow userstory-base.md template structure exactly for all generated stories
- Ensure each story is independently testable and delivers business value
- Apply proper effort estimation and break down stories exceeding limits
- Create sequential US_XXX IDs starting from existing highest ID + 1
- Map all stories to parent epics with clear traceability
- Include comprehensive acceptance criteria using Given/When/Then format

### Content Processing Workflow
1. **Input Analysis**: Determine input type (URL, ID, file, text, or default)
2. **Content Extraction**: Retrieve epic/feature specification from source
3. **Epic Parsing**: Extract requirements, business context, and technical constraints
4. **Story Decomposition**: Break down epic into manageable, testable user stories (think more about each story's value)
5. **Story Generation**: Create individual story files following template structure

## User Story Breakdown Methodology

### Story Sizing and Breakdown Rules
Following CLAUDE.md guidelines:
- **Maximum Story Size**: 5 story points per story
- **Story Point Calculation**: 1 story point = 6 hours of effort
- **Effort Threshold**: Stories requiring >20 hours must be broken down into smaller stories
- **Story Independence**: Each story must be testable independently and deliver business value
- **INVEST Principles**: Stories should be Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, and Testable

### Story Generation Strategy

#### 1. Epic Analysis and Requirements Mapping (Think Deeply)
- **Requirement Extraction**: Identify all functional and non-functional requirements within epic scope
- **Business Value Assessment**: Determine user value and business impact for each requirement
- **Technical Complexity Analysis**: Assess implementation complexity and dependencies (think a lot about hidden complexities)
- **Story Decomposition**: Break requirements into logical, deliverable user stories (keep thinking about user perspective)

#### 2. Story Template Compliance
All generated stories MUST follow the exact structure from `.propel/templates/userstory-base.md`:

**Required Elements:**
- **ID**: Sequential US_XXX format (US_001, US_002, etc.)
- **Title**: Concise, action-oriented title (â‰¤10 words)
- **Description**: "As a [user type], I want [functionality], so that [business value]"
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Given/When/Then format with specific, measurable criteria
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Traceability**: Parent epic mapping and requirement references
- **Tags**: Appropriate classification (FR, NFR, TR, DR, UXR, platform, domain)

#### 3. Effort Estimation and Breakdown
**Story Point Estimation Process:**
1. **Complexity Assessment**: Evaluate technical complexity, unknowns, and dependencies
2. **Effort Calculation**: Estimate development time in hours
3. **Point Assignment**: Convert hours to story points (6 hours = 1 point)
4. **Breakdown Logic**: If story >5 points, decompose into smaller, focused stories
5. **Validation**: Ensure each broken-down story still delivers independent value

### Story File Generation Process

#### File Structure and Organization
**Directory Creation:**
```
Context/Tasks/US_001/US_001.md
Context/Tasks/US_002/US_002.md
Context/Tasks/US_003/US_003.md
...
```

**ID Management:**
- **Sequential Numbering**: Continue from highest existing US_XXX ID
- **Zero-Padded Format**: US_001, US_002, ..., US_999
- **Cross-Epic Continuity**: Maintain sequence across different epics

#### Template Population Process
For each generated story:

1. **Read userstory-base.md**: Load the exact template structure
2. **Create Directory**: Generate Context/Tasks/US_XXX/ directory
3. **Generate Story File**: Create US_XXX.md within the directory
4. **Populate Sections**: Fill all template sections with generated content
5. **Validate Structure**: Ensure template compliance and completeness

### Story Generation Examples

#### Example 1: Authentication Epic (EP-001)
**Input:** EP-001 with requirements FR-001, FR-002, FR-003, NFR-002, TR-004, UXR-001

**Generated Stories:**
```
US_001: User Account Registration
- Description: As a new user, I want to create an account with email validation, so that I can access the platform securely
- Epic: EP-001
- Requirements: FR-001, UXR-001
- Effort: 3 story points

US_002: User Login Authentication
- Description: As a registered user, I want to log in with my credentials, so that I can access my account
- Epic: EP-001
- Requirements: FR-002, NFR-002
- Effort: 2 story points

US_003: Password Reset Functionality
- Description: As a user who forgot their password, I want to reset it via email, so that I can regain account access
- Epic: EP-001
- Requirements: FR-002, UXR-001
- Effort: 4 story points
```

#### Example 2: Large Story Breakdown
**Original Story (8 story points):**
"As an admin, I want to manage the complete user lifecycle, so that I can control platform access"

**Broken Down Stories:**
```
US_XXX: Admin User Creation (3 points)
- As an admin, I want to create new user accounts, so that I can onboard users efficiently

US_XXX: Admin User Role Management (2 points)
- As an admin, I want to assign and modify user roles, so that I can control access permissions

US_XXX: Admin User Deactivation (3 points)
- As an admin, I want to deactivate user accounts, so that I can revoke access when needed
```

### Technical Story Handling

#### New Project Scenarios
When generating stories for new projects without existing codebase:

**Technical Epic Creation (EP-TECH):**
Generate foundational technical stories:
```
US_XXX: Project Structure Setup
- As a developer, I want a properly configured project structure, so that development can begin efficiently

US_XXX: Development Environment Configuration
- As a developer, I want a standardized development environment, so that all team members can work consistently

US_XXX: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
- As a development team, I want automated build and deployment pipelines, so that releases are reliable and efficient
```

#### Technology Stack Integration
Based on identified technology stack in epic/specification:
- **Framework Stories**: Setup and configuration for chosen frameworks
- **Database Stories**: Schema design and connection setup
- **Integration Stories**: API setup and third-party service connections
- **Testing Stories**: Test framework setup and initial test suites

## Implementation Instructions

### Automated Story Generation Flow
```
1. Parse $ARGUMENTS to determine combination type (scope+epic, scope only, epic only, etc.)
2. Extract content based on argument combination:
   - Scope file + Epic ID: Read scope file, filter for specific epic
   - Scope file only: Read scope file, extract all epics
   - Epic ID only: Read Spec.md, find specific epic
   - No arguments: Read Spec.md, extract all epics
3. Parse requirements and business context for identified epic(s)
4. Identify existing US_XXX IDs to determine starting sequence
5. For each epic in scope:
   a. Analyze epic requirements and complexity (think deeply)
   b. Decompose into user-focused stories
   c. Estimate effort and apply breakdown rules
   d. Generate story files with sequential IDs
   e. Populate userstory-base.md template
6. Validate all generated stories for completeness
7. Confirm file structure and content accuracy
8. Report epic processing summary (single epic vs. multiple epics)
```

### Error Handling and Recovery
**Common Error Scenarios:**
- **Missing Source**: Provide clear guidance on valid input options
- **Invalid Epic ID**: List available epics from Spec.md
- **Inaccessible URL**: Request alternative source or local file
- **Empty/Invalid Content**: Ask for clarification or additional detail
- **Template Errors**: Validate against userstory-base.md and regenerate

### Output Confirmation
After successful story generation:
1. **Epic Processing Summary**: Report which epic(s) were processed (specific epic vs. all epics in scope)
2. **Story Generation Report**: List all generated stories with IDs, titles, and parent epic mapping
3. **File Confirmation**: Confirm all directories and files created successfully
4. **Validation Results**: Report on quality validation outcomes
5. **Next Steps**: Suggest follow-up actions (task generation, estimation refinement, etc.)

**Example Output Messages:**
- "Generated 5 user stories for Epic EP-001 from scope_document.md"
- "Generated 23 user stories for 4 epics from scope_document.md"
- "Generated 8 user stories for Epic EP-002 from Context/Docs/Spec.md"
- "Generated 45 user stories for all 7 epics from Context/Docs/Spec.md"
