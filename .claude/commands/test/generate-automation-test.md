# Automation Test Workflow Generator

## Input: $ARGUMENTS (Mandatory)
**Accepts:** Use case analysis | Requirements file path | Feature specification | User story reference

As a Senior QA Engineer expert in Test Automation and Process Design, generate comprehensive automation test workflows based on use case analysis from requirements. This command creates process workflows that serve as blueprints for Playwright automation script generation.

## Core Execution Principles

*** MANDATORY VALIDATIONS ***
- Requirements analysis and use case understanding is required before test workflow creation
- Use case analysis must be extracted from source requirements or provided by user
- Generate test workflows that are directly translatable to Playwright scripts
- **Use sequential thinking MCP for systematic analysis. If unavailable, apply structured analysis approach**
- Request explicit user confirmation (YES/NO) before creating test workflow files
- Create workflows that cover primary paths, edge cases, and error scenarios
- Ensure all test steps are automatable and include proper validation points
- Map test workflows to specific user stories and acceptance criteria

## Test Workflow Design Strategy (Sequential Thinking)

The generated automation test workflows will be consumed by the `generate` command to create executable Playwright scripts. Focus on creating comprehensive process flows that can be directly translated to automation code.

**Use sequential thinking MCP (mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking) for:**
- Systematic requirements analysis and use case extraction
- Complex test workflow planning and validation
- Integration of multiple test scenarios and edge cases
- **Fallback**: If MCP unavailable, use structured written analysis with explicit reasoning sections for each phase

### 1. Requirements Analysis (Sequential Thinking Recommended)
- **Use Case Extraction**: Extract specific use cases from Docs/spec.md in Context folder
- **User Story Mapping**: Map test scenarios to user stories and acceptance criteria
- **Business Process Understanding**: Identify the complete user workflow and business process
- **Actor Analysis**: Understand different user roles and their interaction patterns
- **System Boundary Identification**: Define what parts of the system are being tested
- **Fallback**: Create explicit requirements analysis document with structured sections for each analysis type

### 2. Process Workflow Design (Sequential Thinking Recommended)
- **Step-by-Step Documentation**: Break down user workflows into discrete, testable steps
- **Validation Point Identification**: Define what needs to be verified at each step
- **Selector Strategy**: Plan for stable, maintainable element identification
- **Test Data Planning**: Identify required test data and data management strategy
- **Error Scenario Coverage**: Document expected error conditions and handling
- **Fallback**: Use structured workflow templates with explicit validation checkpoints

### 3. Playwright Integration Planning (Sequential Thinking Recommended)
- **Page Object Strategy**: Plan page object model structure
- **Test Organization**: Organize tests by feature, user journey, or business process
- **Configuration Requirements**: Define browser, viewport, and execution settings
- **Assertion Strategy**: Plan functional, visual, and performance validations
- **Fallback**: Create detailed integration blueprint with explicit technical decisions documented

## Essential Project Intelligence

### Reference Materials Analysis
- **Requirements Document**: Read .propel/context/docs/spec.md for use case analysis and user stories
- **Gotcha Loading**: Apply Conditional Gotcha Loading Strategy from `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with testing focus:
  - Load core gotchas (always)
  - **MANDATORY**: Load automation_testing_gotchas.md (testing context)
  - **MANDATORY**: Load testing_workflow_patterns.md (testing context)
  - Analyze test scope for layer detection (UI tests ‚Üí frontend, API tests ‚Üí backend)
  - Load frontend_best_practices.md if testing UI components
  - Load backend_best_practices.md if testing APIs
  - Load react_gotchas.md only if testing React components explicitly
  - Load dotnet_gotchas.md only if testing .NET APIs explicitly
- **Existing Test Patterns**: Examine any existing test files for patterns and conventions
- **Application Structure**: Understand the application architecture for effective test design
- **User Interface Patterns**: Analyze UI components and interaction patterns

*** Requirements comprehension AND automation testing best practices are essential for quality test workflow generation ***

### Critical Automation Principles
**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY COMPLIANCE**: All generated workflows MUST follow these principles from automation_testing_gotchas.md:

1. **Selector Strategy**: Use role-based locators first, then test-ids, avoid CSS paths and dynamic IDs
2. **Wait Conditions**: Never use hard-coded timeouts, always use proper wait strategies
3. **Test Isolation**: Each test workflow must be completely independent
4. **User-Centric Testing**: Focus on what users see and do, not implementation details
5. **Error Handling**: Include comprehensive error scenarios and validation points

## Test Workflow Framework

### Template Foundation
Base all test workflows on `.propel/templates/automation_test_base.md` structure for consistency.

### Critical Test Context Integration
Package comprehensive context for automation script generation:

**üìã Requirements Context**
- Specific use cases and user stories being tested
- Acceptance criteria and success metrics
- Business rules and validation requirements

**üé≠ User Journey Context**
- Complete user workflow from start to finish
- Different user roles and their specific paths
- Interaction patterns and expected behaviors

**üîß Technical Context**
- Application URLs and entry points
- Authentication and authorization requirements
- Test data requirements and setup needs

**‚ö†Ô∏è Quality Assurance Context**
- Error scenarios and edge cases to test
- Performance and accessibility requirements
- Cross-browser and device testing needs

**üîÑ Automation Strategy**
- Selector strategies and element identification
- Test isolation and cleanup procedures
- Reporting and maintenance approaches

### Process Workflow Architecture

**Workflow Decomposition (Use Sequential Thinking MCP)**
- Break complex user journeys into manageable test scenarios
- Define clear entry and exit criteria for each workflow
- Map workflow steps to specific application actions
- **Fallback**: Use systematic decomposition templates with explicit criteria checklists

**Validation Strategy Design**
- Identify all verification points throughout the workflow
- Plan for functional, visual, and performance validations
- Define assertion strategies for different types of checks

**Error and Edge Case Coverage**
- Document expected error conditions and system responses
- Plan for boundary testing and edge case scenarios
- Include negative testing scenarios

## Context Documentation Requirements

### Essential Test References Package
