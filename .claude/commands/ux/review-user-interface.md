## Visual Comparison & Pixel-Perfect Analysis

{% if figma_design %}
**Design Reference Provided:** `{{ figma_design }}`

**Perform pixel-perfect comparison analysis:**

1. **Interactive UI Testing & Screenshots:**
   - Use `mcp__playwright__browser_install` in headed mode for visual inspection
   - Use `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` to navigate to the modified pages
   - **Interactive Workflow Testing:**
     - Test user workflows step-by-step in headed mode for real-time observation
     - Use `mcp__playwright__browser_click`, `mcp__playwright__browser_type`, `mcp__playwright__browser_hover` to simulate user interactions
     - Verify form submissions, navigation flows, and interactive components
     - Test responsive behavior using `mcp__playwright__browser_resize` at different breakpoints
   - Use `mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot` to capture current implementation
   - Take screenshots at multiple viewports (desktop: 1920x1080, tablet: 768x1024, mobile: 375x667)
   - Use `mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot` for DOM state capture when needed

2. **Design Reference Analysis:**
   {% if figma_design.startswith('http') %}
   - **Figma URL Processing:** Use `WebFetch` to extract design specifications from `{{ figma_design }}`
   - Extract layout dimensions, component specifications, design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
   - Document design system elements and component variants
   {% else %}
   - **Image Mockup Analysis:** Use `Read` tool to analyze the design mockup at `{{ figma_design }}`
   - Compare structural layout, component hierarchy, and visual styling
   - Extract design specifications from the wireframe/mockup image
   {% endif %}

3. **Pixel-Perfect Comparison:**
   - Compare layout dimensions, spacing, typography, colors, and component positioning
   - Document pixel-level discrepancies between design reference and implementation
   - Identify missing or incorrectly positioned elements

4. **Visual Diff Analysis:**
   - Document spacing inconsistencies (margins, padding, gaps)
   - Flag typography mismatches (font sizes, weights, line heights)
   - Identify color palette deviations
   - Note component alignment and sizing issues
   - Report responsive behavior differences across breakpoints

Include this visual comparison analysis in the final design review report with:
- Side-by-side comparison screenshots when possible
- Specific pixel measurements of discrepancies
- Priority rankings for visual fixes (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Implementation recommendations for achieving pixel-perfect alignment

{% else %}
**No design reference provided.** Performing standard design review with interactive testing:

**1. Interactive UI Validation:**
- Use `mcp__playwright__browser_install` in headed mode for live UI inspection
- Navigate to modified pages using `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate`
- **Test Core User Workflows:**
  - Simulate real user interactions with `mcp__playwright__browser_click`, `mcp__playwright__browser_type`
  - Test form validations, error states, and success flows
  - Verify navigation patterns and component state changes
  - Test responsive breakpoints with `mcp__playwright__browser_resize`
- Capture screenshots at key interaction points for documentation
- Use `mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages` to check for JavaScript errors

**2. Standard Design Review Criteria:**
- Design principles and consistency checks
- Component library adherence  
- Accessibility and usability standards
- Visual hierarchy and layout best practices
- Cross-browser compatibility considerations

*Tip: Use the `figma_design` parameter to provide a Figma URL or wireframe image path for pixel-perfect comparison analysis.*
{% endif %}

## Additional Testing Considerations

**Accessibility & Error Monitoring:**
- Use `mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate` to run accessibility audits (e.g., axe-core)
- Monitor `mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages` for JavaScript errors, warnings, or accessibility violations
- Test keyboard navigation using `mcp__playwright__browser_press_key` (Tab, Enter, Escape, Arrow keys)
- Verify focus management and screen reader compatibility
- Test with `mcp__playwright__browser_handle_dialog` for modal and alert interactions

**Performance Insights:**
- Use `mcp__playwright__browser_network_requests` to monitor resource loading
- Capture loading states and performance metrics during interactions
- Document any UI performance issues or slow rendering

**Cross-Device Validation:**
- Use `mcp__playwright__browser_resize` to test tablet (768x1024) and mobile (375x667) breakpoints
- Verify touch interactions work correctly on mobile viewports
- Test responsive navigation patterns (hamburger menus, collapsible sections)

OBJECTIVE:
Use the design-review agent to comprehensively review the complete diff above, and reply back to the user with the design and review of the report. Your final reply must contain the markdown report and nothing else.

Follow and implement the design principles and style guide located in the ../../References/Gotchas/design-principles.md.
