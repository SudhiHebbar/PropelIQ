# Unified Task Executor

## Task File: $ARGUMENTS (Mandatory)

Implement features, fix bugs, or complete development tasks using comprehensive task files. This command ensures systematic, high-quality implementation with thorough validation and quality control.

## Core Execution Principles

*** MANDATORY VALIDATIONS ***
- Load and comprehend the complete task file before starting implementation
- Understand all context by reviewing Docs/Spec.md, Docs/Design.md, and existing codebase
- Verify task completion status - terminate if already completed with "All tasks were implemented"
- Follow all task instructions and extend research when additional context is needed
- Update task file sections based on current codebase state and implementation progress
- Split complex implementations by technology stack (frontend, backend, database) when applicable
- Use TodoWrite tool for systematic progress tracking throughout implementation
- Request explicit confirmation for destructive changes that affect multiple files
- Validate each step before proceeding to maintain code quality and functionality
- Do not copy-paste publicly available code as-is - adapt, understand, and integrate following project patterns

## AI Agent Implementation Strategy

Leverage comprehensive research and context from task files. Access to codebase and web search capabilities enables thorough implementation with proper validation at each stage.

## Deep Implementation Methodology

Optimize for implementation success and code quality over execution speed. Use systematic approach with comprehensive validation.

### 1. Task Comprehension and Planning
- **Task Analysis**: Parse complete task file including context, requirements, and validation criteria
- **UI Impact Assessment**: Determine if task requires UI changes and load design assets accordingly
- **Design Asset Review**: Load Figma links OR design images from task context (UI tasks only)
- **Visual Specification Analysis**: Extract pixel-perfect implementation requirements from design assets
- **Component Design Mapping**: Map visual designs to code components (UI tasks only)
- **Design System Integration**: Apply design tokens and style specifications (UI tasks only)
- **Codebase Assessment**: Review existing code patterns, conventions, and integration points
- **Impact Analysis**: Think longer about cascading effects and identify existing features that may be affected by the implementation, keeping thinking until all potential interactions are uncovered
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify existing implementation patterns to follow for consistency
- **Dependency Mapping**: Understand task dependencies and execution order requirements

### 2. Implementation Planning
- **ULTRATHINK Phase**: Think deeply and extensively to create comprehensive implementation plan, probing deeper into all requirements and their hidden implications
- **Task Breakdown**: Use TodoWrite to create detailed, trackable implementation steps
- **Technology Separation**: Plan frontend, backend, and database components independently when applicable
- **Restoration Points**: Plan strategic code backup points for easy rollback if needed
- **Validation Strategy**: Define testing and validation approach for each implementation step

### 3. Quality Assurance Integration
- **Gotcha Loading**: Apply Conditional Gotcha Loading Strategy from `.claude/CLAUDE.md` based on task file context:
  - Analyze task todos for file extensions and technology keywords
  - Load core gotchas (always)
  - Load layer-based best_practices based on detected layers
  - Load technology-specific gotchas only if React or .NET explicitly detected
- **Code Standards**: Ensure adherence to existing coding standards and project conventions
- **Test Strategy**: Plan unit test creation/updates as mandatory part of implementation
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling following project patterns

## Essential Project Intelligence Integration

### Reference Materials Analysis
- **Gotcha Loading**: Follow Conditional Gotcha Loading Strategy defined in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for optimized, context-aware guidance
- **Design References**: Load `References/Templates/design_reference_base.md` for visual validation criteria (UI tasks only)
- **Codebase Patterns**: Follow existing code organization, naming conventions, and architectural decisions
- **Documentation Standards**: Maintain consistency with existing documentation and inline comments
- **Testing Patterns**: Follow established testing strategies and validation approaches

### External Code Usage Policy

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Do not copy-paste publicly available code as-is**

When referencing external code (Stack Overflow, GitHub, documentation examples):
- **Understand** the code completely before adapting
- **Verify** license compatibility (avoid GPL/AGPL in proprietary projects)
- **Audit** for security vulnerabilities and code quality
- **Adapt** to match existing project patterns and conventions
- **Document** the source and rationale for adaptation
- **Test** thoroughly as if it were original code

**Why this matters:**
- **Legal**: Incompatible licenses can create IP issues
- **Security**: Public code may contain vulnerabilities or malicious code
- **Quality**: May not meet enterprise standards
- **Maintainability**: Team must understand all code in production
- **Customization**: Rarely fits requirements without modification

*** All code must be understood, adapted, and validated by the team ***

*** Existing codebase pattern compliance is mandatory for quality implementation ***

## Systematic Implementation Framework

### Phase 1: Task Loading and Preparation
**Task File Analysis**
- Load and parse complete task file structure
- Extract all requirements, context, and validation criteria
- Identify completion status of existing todo items
- Update task understanding based on current codebase state

**Context Gathering**
- Review Docs/Spec.md, Docs/CodeAnalysis.md and Docs/Design.md for comprehensive understanding
- **Load Design Reference**: Read `Context/Docs/DesignReference.md` and extract design context for task's user stories (UI tasks only)
- **Extract Visual Specifications**: Load Figma URLs OR design images from DesignReference.md sections
- **Parse Design Tokens**: Extract colors, typography, spacing from DesignReference.md for implementation
- **Load Component Mappings**: Use design-to-code mappings from DesignReference.md
- **Validation Criteria**: Extract pixel-perfect requirements from DesignReference.md validation sections
- Map visual components to existing code patterns (UI tasks only)
- Identify design system tokens for consistent styling (UI tasks only)
- Analyze existing codebase for patterns and integration points
- Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` to lock framework/library versions present in the task and codebase before fetching guidance
- Use `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` for technology-specific, version-specific documentation, code examples, design principles and coding standards
- Perform additional web research if task context requires updates
- Document any gaps or additional research findings

### Phase 2: Implementation Planning
**Strategic Planning**
- Create comprehensive TodoWrite plan with all implementation steps
- Break down complex tasks into manageable, testable units
- Plan technology stack separation (frontend/backend/database) when needed
- Identify precise code modification targets using line numbers, function names, variables
- **MANDATORY**: Include "Generate evaluation metrics report" as final todo item before task completion

**Quality Planning**
- Define validation commands and success criteria for each step, thinking exhaustively about potential failure modes
- Plan unit test creation/updates for all new functionality, probing deeper into edge cases and error scenarios
- Establish restoration points for complex code changes, considering all possible rollback requirements
- Define completion criteria and validation gates, reflecting thoroughly on quality benchmarks

### Phase 3: Systematic Implementation
**Code Implementation**
- **Reference Design Document**: Use Context/Docs/DesignReference.md as source of truth for visual specifications (UI tasks only)
- Use Playwright MCP to implement pixel-perfect UI from DesignReference.md visual assets
- Navigate to Figma URLs OR view design images loaded from DesignReference.md during implementation
- Apply design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) extracted from DesignReference.md
- Follow component mappings defined in DesignReference.md sections
- Execute implementation following TodoWrite plan systematically
- Implement all required code following existing project patterns
- Mark each completed todo task as [X] in the task file progressively
- **Update task file checkboxes**: After completing each todo in TodoWrite, immediately update the corresponding checkbox in the source task.md file using Edit tool (`[ ]` → `[X]`)
- Maintain precise targeting using line numbers and function references
- Preserve existing functionality while adding new features

**MCP Validation Loop (pre-commit)**
- **Plan**: Run `mcp__sequential_thinking__plan` to materialize a verification checklist from the task's acceptance criteria and NFRs, thinking thoroughly about all validation requirements.
- **Critique**: Run `mcp__sequential_thinking__critique` mapping real repo evidence (files/endpoints/tests) to each checklist item; capture Pass/Gap/Fail with pointers. Think more critically about each assessment.
- **Reflect**: Run `mcp__sequential_thinking__reflect` to summarize risks and generate the minimal fix list and missing tests to address before proceeding. Reflect deeply on all identified issues before finalizing recommendations.

**Continuous Validation**
- Run validation commands after each significant implementation step
- Fix any failures immediately before proceeding
- Re-run validations until all pass successfully
- **Design Reference Validation**: Use Context/Docs/DesignReference.md as validation criteria source (UI tasks only)
- Use Playwright MCP to capture screenshots of implemented UI against DesignReference.md specifications
- Compare implementation against visual assets referenced in DesignReference.md (Figma OR images)
- Validate design tokens match specifications defined in DesignReference.md
- Check responsive behavior against breakpoints specified in DesignReference.md
- Verify component implementations match mappings in DesignReference.md
- Use Context7 MCP for the review of implemented code against the design principles and coding guidelines
- Update todo progress in real-time

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Validation and Metrics Generation
**Quality Validation**
- Execute complete validation suite as defined in task file
- Verify all checklist items are completed successfully
- Ensure unit tests are created/updated and passing
- Validate logical correctness against requirements

**Integration Testing**
- Test integration with existing functionality to prevent regressions, thinking exhaustively about all interaction patterns
- Validate error handling and edge case scenarios, probing deeper into failure modes
- Confirm adherence to coding standards and project conventions, reflecting thoroughly on consistency
- Verify proper documentation and code comments, considering all aspects of maintainability

**Mandatory Metrics Generation**
⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Generate evaluation metrics table with measured values before task completion. Use validation results, test outputs, and build logs for actual measurements.

## Implementation Quality Standards

### Technology Stack Considerations
- **Frontend Tasks**: Handle UI/UX, client-side logic, and user interactions independently
- **Backend Tasks**: Manage server-side logic, APIs, and business rules separately
- **Database Tasks**: Handle data modeling, migrations, and queries in focused tasks
- **Infrastructure Tasks**: Manage deployment, configuration, and system setup independently

### Code Quality Requirements
- **Pattern Consistency**: Follow existing codebase patterns and architectural decisions
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling following project standards
- **Testing Coverage**: Ensure unit tests cover all new functionality and edge cases
