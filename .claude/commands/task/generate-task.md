# Unified Task Generator


## Input: $ARGUMENTS (Mandatory)
**Accepts:** Feature requirements | User story file | URL | Functional specification

As a Senior Software Engineer expert in Full Stack development, generate comprehensive implementation tasks based on the provided input. This unified command handles all task generation scenarios with consistent quality and thorough research approach.

## Core Execution Principles

*** MANDATORY VALIDATIONS ***
- Understanding the input, design documents, and existing codebase is required before task creation
- If source code is missing, prioritize project creation tasks first
- Continue execution if Design.md is unavailable (optional for user stories)
- ULTRATHINK the implementation ‚Äî analyze approach comprehensively before proceeding
- Request explicit user confirmation (YES/NO) before writing/updating task files
- Update existing files incrementally; avoid unnecessary complete overwrites
- Split tasks exceeding 6 hours into smaller, independently testable units
- Split tasks by technology stack when applicable (separate tasks for frontend, backend, database, etc.)
- Map one task to one requirement/story only ‚Äî NO cross-referencing multiple items
- Single requirements can spawn multiple task files when complexity demands it

## AI Agent Context Strategy

The AI agent receives only your research findings and training data. Since agents have codebase access and equivalent knowledge cutoff, embed comprehensive research findings in the framework. Agents have web search capabilities ‚Äî provide specific documentation URLs and implementation examples.

## Deep Research Methodology

Optimize for success probability over execution speed. Spawn multiple agents and subagents using batch tools for comprehensive analysis.

### 1. Codebase Intelligence Gathering (Sequential Thinking)
- **Design Reference Analysis**: Read `Context/Docs/DesignReference.md` to extract design context for relevant user stories (UI tasks only)
- **User Story Design Mapping**: Identify which user stories this task relates to and extract their design references
- **Visual Asset Loading**: Load Figma URLs OR design images referenced in DesignReference.md for this task's user stories
- **Pattern Discovery**: Search for similar features/implementations in existing codebase
- **Impact Analysis**: Identify existing features requiring modification to maintain functionality
- **Reference Mapping**: Document files and patterns to reference in task design
- **Convention Documentation**: Catalog existing code styles, naming patterns, and architectural approaches
- **Test Pattern Analysis**: Review testing strategies and validation approaches used in the project

### 2. External Knowledge Acquisition
- **Implementation Research**: Search for similar features/patterns in open-source projects
- **Sample Code**: Use `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` for technology-specific, version-specific documentation, code examples, design principles and coding standards
- **Version Pinning**: Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` to pin exact framework/library versions referenced in the task (e.g., .NET 8, EF Core 8, React 19, Python) so subsequent docs/examples are version-accurate.
- **Design Asset Integration**: Reference Figma links OR design images in task context (only when UI impact exists)
- **UI Implementation Guidance**: Include specific design specifications from visual assets (Figma frames OR image files)
- **Component Mapping**: Map design components to code implementation patterns
- **Visual Validation Criteria**: Define pixel-perfect implementation requirements using available design references
- **Style Guidelines**: Research project-specific or framework coding standards
- **Documentation Deep-Dive**: Library documentation with specific section URLs
- **Example Collection**: GitHub repositories, StackOverflow solutions, technical blog implementations
- **Best Practice Synthesis**: Industry patterns, performance considerations, and common pitfalls

### 3. Contextual Clarification (When Needed)
- **Pattern Alignment**: Which existing implementations should be mirrored and their locations?
- **Integration Requirements**: How should new features integrate with existing systems?
- **Quality Standards**: What testing, documentation, and validation standards apply?

## Essential Project Intelligence

### Reference Materials Analysis
- **Gotchas Repository**: Examine `\References\Gotchas` for technology-specific guidelines, anti-patterns, and implementation warnings
- **Codebase Structure**: Explore `app`, `backend`, `server` folders for existing code patterns and architectural decisions
- **Documentation Review**: Study existing README files, API documentation, and inline code comments

*** Codebase comprehension is non-negotiable for quality task generation ***

## Task Design Framework

### Template Foundation
Base all tasks on `References/Templates/task_base.md` structure for consistency.
Integrate design context from `References/Templates/design_reference_base.md` for UI tasks only.

### Critical Context Integration

- Integration points and data flow diagrams  
- Performance and scalability considerations

**üíª Implementation Context**
- Real code snippets from existing codebase
- Configuration examples and environment setup
- Error handling patterns used in the project

**üé® Design Context (UI Impact Only)**
- **Design Reference Source**: Context/Docs/DesignReference.md#US-XXX (extracted for this task's user stories)
- **Visual References**: Figma URLs OR design images loaded from DesignReference.md
- **Design System Tokens**: Colors, typography, spacing extracted from design reference document
- **Component Specifications**: Visual asset references from DesignReference.md sections

- **Component Documentation**: Visual specs from DesignReference.md component mappings
- **Design-to-Code Mapping**: Guidelines extracted from design reference document
- **Pixel-Perfect Requirements**: Implementation criteria from DesignReference.md validation sections

**Example Task Design Reference**:
```yaml
Design Context:
  source_document: Context/Docs/DesignReference.md#US-001
  user_story: US-001 - User Login Interface
  visual_references:
    figma_url: https://figma.com/file/xyz?node-id=2:45
    # OR design_images: Context/Design/US-001/login_mockup.png
  design_tokens:
    primary_color: "#007AFF"
    typography: "SF Pro Display, 32px, 600"
  validation_criteria:
    screenshot_comparison: true
    pixel_tolerance: 5%
    responsive_breakpoints: [375px, 768px, 1440px]
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Knowledge**

### Implementation Blueprint Architecture

**Pseudocode Foundation**
- Start with high-level algorithmic approach
- Break down complex operations into manageable steps
- Reference real files demonstrating similar patterns

**Error Resilience Strategy**  
- Identify potential failure points and mitigation approaches
- Document rollback procedures for destructive operations
- Plan validation checkpoints throughout implementation

**Version Pinning** 
- Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` to pin exact framework/library versions referenced in the task (e.g., .NET 8, EF Core 8, React 19, Python, Java) so subsequent docs/examples are version-accurate.


**Sequential Task Breakdown**
- List implementation tasks in logical dependency order
- Include mandatory unit test creation/updates for each component
- Define clear completion criteria and validation gates

**Versioned Doc Excerpts** 
- Include excerpts/links retrieved via `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` (tied to IDs from `resolve-library-id`) for patterns the task expects (validation, transactions, async I/O, HTTP semantics).


## Context Documentation Requirements

### Essential References Package
- **Technical Documentation**: All URLs, guides, and examples needed for implementation
- **Implementation Examples**: Complex code snippets with explanations and context
- **Integration Points**: How the feature connects with existing systems
- **Quality Gates**: Testing requirements, performance benchmarks, security validations

## Output Specifications

**File Naming Convention**: `Context/Tasks/task_<seqnum>_<descriptive_name>.md`

**Sequence Number Logic**:
- Auto-increment based on existing task files in directory
- Use zero-padded 3-digit format (001, 002, 003...)
- Descriptive name should reflect primary functionality being implemented
